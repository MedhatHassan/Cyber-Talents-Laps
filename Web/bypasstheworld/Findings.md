#### We try to use escape character
In PHP the escape character is the backslash `\`. The backslash is used to escape special characters in strings. When you precede a special character with a backslash, it is treated as a literal character rather than its special meaning.

Common escape sequences in PHP include:
- `\\` for a literal backslash
- `\"` for a literal double quote
- `\'` for a literal single quote
- `\n` for a newline
- `\t` for a tab
- `\r` for a carriage return
