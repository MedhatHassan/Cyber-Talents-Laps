# Solve Hide Data
### https://cybertalents.com/challenges/cryptography/hide-data

in the lab description I used to hide my data with a **classic cypher**

#### Try to decrypt with Caesar cipher 
```

```
Classical Caesar cipher doesn't work

#### Write a python script to create all the combinations of shift the find the flag
*the script is in [decryptor](decryptor.py)*
The flag is shifted `13` a -> n
```
the flag is 2j68yfhqlz It is pretty easy to see the flag but can you see it i took nearly 1 minute to encode this with ROT13 good luck in solving that
